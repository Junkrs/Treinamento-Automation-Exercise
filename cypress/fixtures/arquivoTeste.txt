“Dinosaurs” was a classic American sitcom that aired from 1991 to 1994, created by Michael Jacobs and Bob Young, and produced by Jim Henson Productions.

The show followed the Sinclair family, a group of anthropomorphic dinosaurs living in a modern, satirical prehistoric world. It mixed puppet animatronics (created by Jim Henson’s Creature Shop) with sharp social commentary on topics like consumerism, gender roles, and the environment — all wrapped in humor suitable for families.

🦕 Main Characters:

Earl Sinclair – The father, a blue-collar worker at the “WeSaySo Corporation.”

Fran Sinclair – The loving, sensible mother who often keeps the family together.

Robbie Sinclair – The teenage son, rebellious and curious.

Charlene Sinclair – The fashion-loving, materialistic daughter.

Baby Sinclair – The youngest, famous for his catchphrase “Not the mama!”

The show was surprisingly deep — its final episode was a dark and memorable allegory about environmental destruction, ending with the extinction of the dinosaurs due to their own actions.
